Here's a quick rundown of its main features:

## Features
The current features are:

### Oscillators

The synthesizer includes two oscillators, each capable of producing sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth waves. Additionally, users can fine-tune the sound with detune, pulse-width, and semitone sliders.

### Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO)

The LFO introduces modulation capabilities with various waveforms, including sine, triangle, square, sawtooth, and noise. Users can apply LFO modulation to pitch, pulse-width, and volume parameters.

### Filters

Highpass and lowpass filters are available to shape the frequency content of the generated audio.

### Envelopes

Volume and pitch envelopes provide dynamic control over the sound. Users can adjust attack, decay, sustain, and release phases to shape the transient and sustained characteristics.

### Chorus Effect

A 2-4 voices chorus effect with detune slider.

### Keyboard Interaction

The synthesizer supports keyboard interaction, allowing users to play melodies. Adjusting octaves is convenient using the number keys, providing flexibility in pitch range.
